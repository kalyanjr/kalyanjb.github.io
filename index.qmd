Hi, I'm Kalyan Bandaru, a data scientist with partial interest in cybersecurity. With a background in computer science, I have worked as an Engineering Intern at BeyondSquareSolution pvt ltd and FireEye, where I have gained valuable experience in the field of cybersecurity. During my time at these companies, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects, including academic ones focused on networking and computer security. I was also the lead member on one of the projects I completed.
